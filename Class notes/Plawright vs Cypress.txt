PW:

- Playwright is faster
- Support to JS/TS, Python, Java, C# (default is TS)
- Free parallel execution
- It can handle multiple labs
- Better with iFrames, smooth experience
-  It's comfortable transition from selenium, since the locators accesses are kinda similar

Cypress:

- Faster scripting, which means less code
- Better to handle auto-wait mechanism, to wait elements load in the screen
- Clear documentation
- Better test runner than Playwright
- Dashboard service, but it's paid
