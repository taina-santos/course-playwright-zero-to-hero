Same sintax, but typescritpt prevent us to assign different type of values in the same variable

You can also explicit assign the type of variable when declare
var name:string = "your name"
var age:number = 33

Typescript also allows you to create a custom type
type Person = {name: string, age: number, active: boolean}
var firstPerson: Person = {
  name: "tay",
  age: 33,
  active: true
}

Works with same idea of class/object from what we have in java
